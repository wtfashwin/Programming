Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 62.91%Submissions: 170K+Points: 4
Given the head of two sorted linked lists consisting of nodes respectively. The task is to merge both lists and return the head of the sorted merged list.

Examples:

Input: head1 = 5 -> 10 -> 15 -> 40, head2 = 2 -> 3 -> 20
Output: 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 10 -> 15 -> 20 -> 40
Explanation:

Input: head1 = 1 -> 1, head2 = 2 -> 4
Output: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4
Explanation:

Constraints:
1 <= no. of nodes<= 103
0 <= node->data <= 105

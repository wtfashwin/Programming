'''
Given an array arr[] of n integers and an integer target, the task is to find a pair in arr[] such that itâ€™s sum is closest to target.

Note: Return the pair in sorted order and if there are multiple such pairs return the pair with maximum absolute difference. If no such pair exists return an empty array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [10, 30, 20, 5], target = 25
Output: [5, 20]
Explanation: Out of all the pairs, [22, 30] has sum = 25 which is closest to 25.

Input: arr[] = [5, 2, 7, 1, 4], target = 10
Output: [2, 7]
Explanation: As (4, 7) and (2, 7) both are closest to 10, but absolute difference of (2, 7) is 5 and (4, 7) is 3. Hence,[2, 7] has maximum absolute difference and closest to target.

Input: arr[] = [10], target = 10
Output: []
Explanation: As the input array has only 1 element, return an empty array.'''

            minDiff = abs(target - currSum)
            res = [arr[left], arr[right]]

        # If this pair has less sum, move to greater values

        # If this pair has sum = target, return it

'''
Given two sorted arrays of sizes m and n respectively, the task is to find the element that would be at the k-th position in the final sorted array formed by merging these two arrays.

Examples: 

Input: a[] = [2, 3, 6, 7, 9], b[] = [1, 4, 8, 10], k = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: The final sorted array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The 5th element is 6.

Input: a[] = [100, 112, 256, 349, 770], b[] = [72, 86, 113, 119, 265, 445, 892], k = 7
Output: 256
Explanation: The final sorted array is [72, 86, 100, 112, 113, 119, 256, 265, 349, 445, 770, 892]. The 7th element is 256.

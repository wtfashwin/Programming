'''Given an array of integers arr[] of size n, the task is to rotate the array elements to the left by d positions.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, d = 2
Output: {3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2}
Explanation: After first left rotation, arr[] becomes {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1} and after the second rotation, arr[] becomes {3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2}

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3}, d = 4
Output: {2, 3, 1}
Explanation: The array is rotated as follows:

After first left rotation, arr[] = {2, 3, 1}
After second left rotation, arr[] = {3, 1, 2}
After third left rotation, arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
After fourth left rotation, arr[] = {2, 3, 1}

Using Juggling Algorithm - O(n) Time and O(1) Space
The idea is to use Juggling Algorithm which is based on rotating elements in cycles. Each cycle is independent and represents a group of elements that will shift among themselves during the rotation. If the starting index of a cycle is i, then next elements of the cycle can be found at indices (i + d) % n, (i + 2d) % n, (i + 3d) % n ... and so on till we return to the original index i.

So for any index i, we know that after rotation, the element that will occupy this position is arr[(i + d) % n]. Consequently, for every index in the cycle, we will place the element that should be in that position after the rotation is completed.

Please refer Juggling Algorithm for Array Rotation to know more about the implementation.

Auxiliary Space: O(1) '''

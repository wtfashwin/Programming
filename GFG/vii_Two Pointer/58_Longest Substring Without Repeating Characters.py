'''
Given a string s having lowercase characters, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. 

Examples:

Input: s = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: 7
Explanation: The longest substrings without repeating characters are "eksforg‚Äù and "ksforge", with lengths of 7.

Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest substring without repeating characters is "a"

Input: s = "abcdefabcbb"
Output: 6
Explanation: The longest substring without repeating characters is "abcdef".

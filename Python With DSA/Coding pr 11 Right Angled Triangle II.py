# Right Angled Triangle II
# Problem Description:

# You are given an integer n. Your task is to return a right-angled triangle pattern of '*', where each row contains stars aligned to the right. The first row has one star, the second row has two stars, and so on, until the nth row has n stars.



# Input:

# A single integer n, where 1 <= n <= 100.



# Output:

# A list of strings where each string represents a row in the right-angled triangle, right-aligned.



# Example:

# Input: 4
# Output: ['   *', '  **', ' ***', '****']
 
# Input: 3
# Output: ['  *', ' **', '***']
